for linux users:
if you are running linux,ubuntu or any other version then you are in luck. just execute "run.sh" file in the command prompt. it will show you the output.

if you do not have OpenGL setup, then run this command with internet on.

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install freeglut3 && sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev && sudo apt-get install binutils-gold && sudo apt-get install g++ cmake && sudo apt-get install libglew-dev && sudo apt-get install g++ && sudo apt-get install mesa-common-dev && sudo apt-get install build-essential && sudo apt-get install libglew1.5-dev libglm-dev

it will take a lot of time depending on your internet speed. Or you can go to this link and install OpenGL .

for windows users:
find video on youtube on how to install openGL.
after installing go to 3Dhouse.cpp file. uncomment this line-> "#include <windows.h>"
hopefully it will get you working with it.


feel free to ask any question.
Happy Coding!
